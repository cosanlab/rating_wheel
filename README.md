# Javascript Rating Wheel
This Javascript library was developed by Jenna Perry while she was a summer intern at the CosanLab.  It is based off of the [Geneva Emotion Wheel](https://www.affective-sciences.org/gew/) and contains a discrete and continuous version.

This project is still a work in progress and has not been fully tested.  Use with caution and please submit any bugs as issues.
